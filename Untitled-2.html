                  <p> Throughout my time at Vinal, I have bounced between many different interests and one seemed to stick with me, and that just so happened to be art, both 3D and 2D. Below you will see some of my finished pieces.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>My personal software of choice is Blender, a common and free app that is useful for both beginners, and professionals and there is always more to learn about the inner workings.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                Over my 4 years at this school, I have massively changed as a person but despite that, some interests have stayed the same. I continued my 14 years of soccer and became captain in my sophomore year and became the best goalkeeper in my division (charter oak) in my Senior year and nominee freshman year. Along with sports, I joined the schools GSA program thought the runtime of the group was brief, it didn't fail to teach me new experiences.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </div>

                  <p> In my earlier years, I had first picked up a love for computer art through photoshop and other such Adobe products. I would teach myself and use their provided online tutorials to expand my knowledge and increase my fluidity with the software and its workings.</p>
                  <p>Over time I learned more in depth on how to create what I can imagine in my head and to make those rough ideas a fully in depth image in high detail.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

I decided to come to Vinal because I believed that I could get a head start in the field that I want to be in for the rest of my life, and I knew this would be beneficial for me and substantially better than my hometowns school in practically every single way imaginable. When having to pick a trade, I chose IT for a lot of reasons despite my original passion being the auto shop, however the reasons I picked it over my other options were how broad IT is as a whole. After looking into multiple different kinds of work I found I am most passionate when it comes to Graphic Design, 3D Modeling, art, and many other variations of computer based art that make up that fall under a multitude of labels and names.In my academic work I have continuously excelled, keeping my position in honors and high honors throughout all 4 years I have been through. I have consistently retained above a 3.0 weighted GPA through the years I have spent at Vinal and finish every assignment I’m given turned in on time and with my absolute full effort put in. Any time I was given an assignment I would use my time in class to finish it, and if I couldn’t I would take any opportunity during any free time I had throughout the day to finish before its due date.For my shop I chose IT mainly for the aforementioned reasons, as well as how much the IT field is involved in the workforce right now. Firstly, I liked how broad the shop of IT is. It covers everything from coding and programming to cybersecurity and ethical hacking and I knew that I could find something enjoyable to study even if it wasn’t the first thing I picked up. Secondly, I knew that if I needed help with anything I was doing I could go to my peers as well as my teachers knowing I would get the help and support I needed. Many people have helped me all through the school year, from my personal projects I wanted to do at home, to work I found rather difficult at the moment. I also had teachers I could show these projects to and get professional feedback to refine my work and projects. Finally, I knew there were hundreds of well paying job opportunities in fields that I’m truly passionate about that I could look forward to after I graduate from school.Throughout my life I have always liked to create, whether it was drawing for hours on end or building “useless junk” out of old wood from my withering playset. Learning Blender and making art in school only boosted my love significantly for that kind of stuff even more. The most satisfying thing for me is seeing my thoughts and rough ideas come to life in front of my eyes knowing that I had made whatever from the depths of my mind. At Vinal, my shop teachers gave me everything they could to ensure that I had everything I needed to succeed and solve any problems that came up while I was working.Even though I am absolutely a stereotypical “IT nerd” it's not the only thing I do and excel at. My whole life for as long as I can remember I have played sports, the most notable of which being soccer, and as I grew, my passion for the sport grew alongside me. After learning Vinal had a soccer team, I immediately joined in my freshman year, and to put it bluntly, it was the absolute worst team I had ever played for. But despite this fact, I still loved playing, I had made new friends and relationships and I had fun, even if we lost every single game and didnt have a coach for the majority of the season. Eventually I had become the team's goalkeeper, after a summer of training at camps, I had become a rather decent player and had become a captain in my sophomore year. Eventually in my Junior year, I saw growth in the team, exponential growth, we had started being a competitive team to be taken seriously. At the end of the season, I was runner up for the “Charter Oak All Conference” which is the best of the best in the division. At the end of the season I was already ecstatic to start the next one because I knew we would be the best we have ever been. For the First time on record, Vinyl Tech had made it to “States” meaning we had won enough games to play against the best in other divisions all throughout connecticut. Not long after this, I had become the #1 Pick for the “Charter Oak All Conference” goalkeeper. Making this the absolute best team I have ever played on, and I know I have done my best.I am deeply sad that this chapter of my life is coming to an end, but it's also a bittersweet sadness. I know I have done good and I'm happy with how I've done and if I could do it all over again, I wouldn’t change a thing. This portfolio will show off my achievements, projects, certifications, skills, etc in more depth. Everything will be explained in detail with photo and video examples depicting me and my peers. My goal after high school is to further my education in Graphic Design and Digital Art. I’d also like to get a job in the field as soon as I possibly can to learn exactly what working in the field everyday is like so I can excel anywhere I go later in life."
